# COVID19 Healthcare Analytics on Rural Health 
---
An analysis on COVID19 spread and infection in rural counties in the United States.

## Background

In the US, there is a great inequality seeking medical care. According to an [Oct 2020 NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/07/920587019/getting-health-care-was-already-tough-in-rural-areas-the-pandemic-has-made-it-wo), the global pandemic has brought many of the health inequities to light; specifically, the inequitable access to healthcare between urban and rural counties. This results in dire consequences for rural families and individuals who have fewer operating hospitals and fewer medical staff. 

Rural healthcare inequity is a well documented issue. According to my prior [literary analysis in rural healthcare](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jrh.12494) with Professor Brent Fulton of the Petris Center at the University of California, Berkeley, rural hospitals have faced increased hardships as more counties have seen an outflow of individuals from rural counties to more urban cities and suburban areas. This among other factors contribute to a rural population that has become poorer, sicker, and older in comparison to their urban counterparts. An article presented by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2019/10/25/urbanization-leaves-rural-america-in-a-health-care-crisis/?sh=a913d761b2ae) outlines how rural populations only make up 20% of the US population (disproportionately bear a large proportion of high cost medical procedures) and are plagued with older, sicker, and poorer populations. Rural populations, according to a [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882339/), are more likely to not have reasonable access to healthcare, a problem exacerbated by the pandemic. (will have to operationalize the definition of reasonable) According to the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/race), rural counties like Trousdale, TN (with a population of 9,783 people as of 2018, and is almost all white) are suffering from the highest rates of infection, and other rural counties like Jerauld, SD (with a population of roughly 2000 people, also all white) are suffering from the highest incidence of death by COVID-19.
